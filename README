1. How to build 

  You need gcc to build the tagger.

  > make

  if you encounter errors with hash, try commenting out "#define USE_HASH_MAP"
  in "maxent.h".


2. How to use

  Prepare a text file containing one sentence per line, then

  > ./geniatagger < TEXTFILE > TAGGEDTEXT

  The tagger outputs the base forms, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and chunk tags
  in the following tab-separated format.

  word1	base1	POStag1	chunktag1
  word2	base2	POStag2	chunktag2
    :     :        :       :

  Chunks are represented in the IOB2 format (B for BEGIN, I for INSIDE, and O
  for OUTSIDE).


 2.1 Tokenization

  This tagger tokenizes the sentence with almost the same policy as the
  upenn tokenizer (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/tokenizer.sed). 

  If you don't want the tagger to perform tokenization, use -nt option.
  In that case, the input sentences should be already tokenized by your
  own tokenizer with white spaces.
